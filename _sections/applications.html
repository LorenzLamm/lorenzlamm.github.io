<h3 class="alt"><strong>Artificial Intelligence for Microscopy</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We focus on developing novel AI-based algorithms for microscopy image processing, including cell segmentation, detection, classification and quantification. Particularly, we target a few key challenges in microscopy images:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Real biological signal mingled with experiment noise and batch variations.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Inadequate or no ground-truth labels available. </li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Datasets of highly unbalanced classes. </li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
We work on both classic microscopy modalities, such as bright-field and fluorescence microscopy, and advanced ones, such as Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.cellarchlab.com/">Dr. Ben Engel’s group</a> at Helmholtz Pioneer Campus) and extended depth-of-field (EDOF) microscope with “Electrically Tunable Lenses” (ETL, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.geomar.de/en/jtaucher">Dr. Jan Taucher in GEOMAR</a>) 
</p>

<h3 class="alt"><strong>Computational Pathology</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our goal is to develop novel AI methods to aid trained professional pathologists in their decision-making, with a special emphasis on three aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Self-supervised hierarchical image feature extraction that highlights a small number of key pixels leading to accurate diagnoses.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confident measures that assess the reliability of AI predictions.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Human-in-the-loop processes that make AI models more accessible and explainable by facilitating interaction between algorithms and experts.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We collaborate closely with <a href="https://web.med.tum.de/en/path/institute/people/senior-pathologists/">PD. Dr. med Melanie Boxberg in TUM pathology</a> on computational pathology.</p>
