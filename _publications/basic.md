Quantitative analysis of bioimaging data is often skewed by both shading in space and background variation in time. We introduce BaSiC, an image correction method based on low-rank and sparse decomposition which solves both issues. In comparison to existing shading correction tools, BaSiC achieves high-accuracy with significantly fewer input images, works for diverse imaging conditions and is robust against artefacts. Moreover, it can correct temporal drift in time-lapse microscopy data and thus improve continuous single-cell quantification. BaSiC requires no manual parameter setting and is available as a Fiji/ImageJ plugin.
