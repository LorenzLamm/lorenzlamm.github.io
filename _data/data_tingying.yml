    title: Profile
    summary: |
      I am a PhD student, shared between the Peng lab and the<a href="https://www.cellarchlab.com/"> Engel lab</a>. The aim of this PhD project is to develop Deep Learning methods to make the analysis of 3D Cryo-electron tomography more efficient.

      As an application, we are analyzing plant cells, in particular those parts of the chloroplasts that are involved in photosynthesis. For this, we need to have accurate 3D segmentations of the thylakoid membranes, as well as precise localizations of the single proteins contained in these membranes, for example Photosystem-II complexes.
